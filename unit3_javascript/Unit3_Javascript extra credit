// Please complete the following questions to earn additional credit toward your grade.


// 1. In your own words, describe what a function is? What is a reason why we use functions to create programs.
"A function bascically is something in a block of code created or designed to perform special task , A reason why we use functions to create programs is because they allow us to break down the complex programs into smaller manageble parts making code more organized and more readable , and easier to maintain. "

// 2. Please create a function that will accept a number and then calculate that number by 12 and then subtract it by 5. Then use the console.log() or print() functions to return your answer.

function calculateResult(number)   {
    // Divide the number by 12
    let result = number / 12;

    // subtract 5 
    result = result -5;

    // Output the result
    console.log(result);

}

//Example usage:
calculateResult(24); // This will print the reult of (24 / 12) - 5

// hint: you will need to pass your number in as a parameter- inside the round brackets.

// 3. Please creat a function that will accept a name as a string and contatonate that string in a message that welcomes the person to coding class by name. Then return the result using the print() or console.log function.
// ex. your message should say "hello (person's Name)! Welcome to coding!

function welcomeToClass(name)   {
    // Concatenate the name into a welcome message
    let message = "welcome to coding class, " + name + "!";

    //output the message
    console.log(message);
}

// Example usage:
welcomeToClass("Alice"); // This will print: welcome to coding class , Alice! 

// 4. Create a function that will compare a number to 17. If the number is larger than 17, it should return true, and if the number is smaller than 17 it should return false. Use the console.log() function and print() function to output the result.
// hint 1: you will need to use one of the comparison operators. hint 2: you will need to pass your number in as a parameter- inside the round brackets?

function compareTo17(number) {
    // compare the number to 17 
    if (number > 17 )  {
        console.log(true); //if the number is larger than 17 , print true
    } else {
        console.log(false); // if the number is smaller than or equal to 17 , print false
        

        }
    }




// 5. Please create a function that when it is run will show the instructions on how to create a cheese steak sandwich.

// 6. Please explain what the difference is between a function call and a function definition?
